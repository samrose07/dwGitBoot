      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <h6>Who is anyone?</h6>
      <p> I am but a programmer. A designer, if you will. At a young age I started writing stories to present to my parents. Most of these stories were based off of old showa era Godzilla characters (they were the most silly, of course) and were written in nothing other than scribbles. I made these stories up as I presented them. Further along the line when I had access to the home computer I started writing real stories. I always wanted to finish a novel or write a perfect movie, but one thing that I didn't dare attempt to write was a video game.</p>
      <h2>They are now my bread and butter.</h2>
      <p>I have always played video games. My first one was in fact Pokemon Blue version for the original gameboy, borrowed from my older brothers. My first major console experience was Halo: Combat Evolved (much to my mother's dismay and my father's delight). But I wasn't allowed to play that one, so I begged my mom to buy me Godzilla: Save the Earth for the original xbox console. Godzilla is a common theme here, yes. This was the first game that I sunk days - perhaps even weeks - of playtime into. I still have the copy today, but I am unable to play it on current gen consoles.</p>
      <h2>I get it. Get to the point where you started developing games!</h2>
      <p>When I was going into the ninth grade my two older brother's were still in high school, thus living at home. This meant we all had to share our Xbox 360 and I didn't get nearly as much playtime as I had liked. Call of Duty was all the craze at this point and I came across a visual glitch during one of my multiplayer matches. This sparked a new curiosity in the recesses of my thoughts. This started my journey into programming.<br />
        Whilst my brother's were playing their games I hopped onto the good ol' family computer. I went to YouTube and searched "How to program" and clicked on the first tutorial I found. It was a tutorial for learning C++ on Microsoft's visual studio and I followed the entire series that creator made. I learned if-else statements, for-loops, how to create a calculator, and even how to create a leap-year determinate. All these projects utilized a command prompt looking interaction module. I was reminded of the Zork easter egg in Call of Duty: Black Ops, so I became inspired to create my own text-based adventure game.<br />
        I had big plans for it; choose your name, starting location, explore a rundown supermarket, find and tame Pokemon, and live out your wildest dreams inside of this text-based virtual world. I only got to the supermarket part in my programming that night and decided to leave it be for a while.</p>
      <h2>How did I take my learning further?</h2>
      <p>In ninth grade I took a technology elective based around many different practices. We delved into sketch-free art, Scratch, Arduino, Autodesk, hydraulic systems, etc. It was at the sketch-free portion where I created a cornucopia-like design, shouted yes and threw my arms up, and smiled wide when my teacher used me as an example of "what true love and passion for a craft can look like." I didn't know what this meant at the time, but once I got into high school I started to.</p>
      <h2>High School, HTML, and hacking.</h2>
      <p>In my 10th grade I took the class "exploring computer science." This class was based around HTML for the most part, in which I created my first ever website: respace. This was meant to be the best source for gaming news and it even used the same off-white background as this website! The teacher hoped to have our final project be on making our website secure and have a hackathon where we'd get extra points for the number of peers' websites we hacked into. I think she noticed this was a bad idea so she decided to leave that thought behind. Still, the idea of getting into the meat and potatoes of how something works (not just a website, but anything coding based) piqued my interest. I haven't done much with that interest, but it has kept me dedicated to learning more about the bones of any great project.</p>
      <h2>That's then, what about now and later?</h2>
      <p>I am currently a student at Boise State University pursuing the Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Design major. I originally took GIMM 110 as a filler class as it was titled "introduction to programming." I was then enrolled as a CS major and needed a programming class to fill in my catalog. Once I arrived on that first day though, I never looked back. I immediately switched over to GIMM as my major and have made friends and memories that would not be possible anywhere else. Through the semesters I've made games based on top-down mechanics, wave based survival, interactive comics and stories, character and scene concept arts, physical computing architectures and I've been introduced to interactive audio, and finally I've been writing lore for every project I make that is located in the GTGLore website linked in the navigation bar. Go check it out! I am currently in the game design theory class, a web and mobile design class, and an augmented reality class through this major. Life is good so far. My mother told me "I always knew you'd do something in video games," even after she tried to get me to go outside for my entire childhood. Take that mom.</p>
      <h3>TLDR: I love to make and play games. Check out my portfolio below for visual illustrations of what I've made in my short college experience.</h3>
